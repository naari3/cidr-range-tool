# CIDR Range Tool

https://naari3.github.io/cidr-range-tool/

This is a simple web tool to calculate the range of IP addresses from a CIDR notation.

- I made this tool because I felt uncomfortable with the fact that all the CIDR range calculation tools in the world were making requests to the server, so I prepared a tool that calculates immediately on the client side.
